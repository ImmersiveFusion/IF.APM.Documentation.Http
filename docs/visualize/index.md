Immersive Fusion defines application performance monitoring (APM) as software that empowers the observation of application behavior and its infrastructure dependencies, users, and business key performance indicators (KPIs) during the application’s life cycle. Immersive Fusion APM can recognize an application’s behavior by deploying internally (3D Desktop Client), or as software as a service (SaaS), Web Client.

The Immersive Fusion APM client provides a vantage point into your application, and its architecture, process flow, and performance. Users connect to the Immersive APM infrastructure and explore real-time application operations. In addition, Immersive APM provides application analytics, environment status, and insight into your application architecture and run-time behavior.
 
Our application performance monitoring assistant, Immersive Fusion APM, lays out comprehensive information about the database and its underlying processes. Explore queries consuming added time and point to it with the help of details like average, minimum, maximum, and total response times for all DB queries. 

An immersive Fusion APM tool has a powerful analytics platform that ingests, analyzes, and builds context from traces, metrics, and logs. 
 
The core capabilities of the Immersive Fusion APM software tool include:
 
-	Automated detection and mapping of application and its infrastructure components
-	Observation of an application’s complete HTTP/S transactional performance
-	Monitoring of applications running on browser and desktop
-	Identification of likely root causes of application performance problems and their impact on business outcomes
-	Analysis of business KPIs and user journeys (for example, log in to check-out)
