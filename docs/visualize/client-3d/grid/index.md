The grid in Immersive APM shows application throughput and overall flow.  An empty grid means the application is idle.  A grid where operations turn green before they land is healthy.  Simple status colors give the grid its ambient meaning: a mix of green (success), orange (delay), red (error) is generally what one can expect in a live ecosystem.
