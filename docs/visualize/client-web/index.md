The Web Client is the secondary visualization and analysis tool for Immersive APM. The Web Client brings your data to life and gives you the power to explore your environment and application execution, time-travel back to any past application load and explore the detailed, full picture of your landscape when past errors occurred. The client uses recorded trace data sent by your application. Users can review near real-time activity information, high-level and and granular details of application state and health as well as historic summary and analysis.

!!! note "Professional/Enterprise subscription required"
    The Web client relies on recorded trace data that is available under the Professional and Enterprise subscriptions. Basic subscriptions should be upgraded before the web client can show any data.
