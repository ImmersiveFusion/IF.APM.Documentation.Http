# Live Demo

**Immersive Fusion demonstration deployments require no setup effort**. We want to you experience the power of the telemetry and how it can be analyzed and visualized with minimal effort.

## Chaos Simulator

![Immersive Fusion OpenTelemetry Chaos Simulator](img/screenshot.png)

The Immersive Fusion [OpenTelemetry Chaos Simulator](https://github.com/ImmersiveFusion/if-opentelemetry-chaos-simulator-sample){:target="gh"} is an Open Source application that is available at [demo.iapm.app](//demo.iapm.app){:target="if-demo"} It is a simple Angular/ASP.NET Core application that answers the question "What's the point?". It allows you to inject/eject failures into an application and see how those failures affect the telemetry that is generated. It is already pre-configured with an OpenTelemetry exporter so you don't need to change any code or enter any API keys simply log into [Immersive APM for 3D and VR](../../../Analysis-and-Visualization/3D-and-VR/index.md) to see the results the actions your perform.

<!-- or [Immersive APM for Web & Mobile](../../../Analysis-and-Visualization/web/)  -->

!!! info "Real-time Only"
    The OpenTelemetry Chaos Simulator currently is enabled only for real-time data. The telemetry generated by it will not be visible in Immersive APM for Web & Mobile.
    

## Sandbox

A new sandbox is created for you when you access the simulator. You can come back to an existing or make a bookmark if you like. Once the sandbox is loaded, clicking buttons to perform actions or introduce chaos will be available momentarily.
