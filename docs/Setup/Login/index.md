# Login

## Options

Requiring users to login to use a service is a common practice that is implemented by many online services and applications. While it can be seen as an inconvenience to some users, there are several reasons why login is necessary such as Security, Personalization, Quality Assurance and Payment and Subscriptions.

We want to make the experience to be as quick and simple as possible by offering multiple login options. This practice is becoming increasingly popular as more and more services move online. These options provide users with a choice of authentication methods and allow them to use their preferred identity providers to access multiple services.

It's a matter of convenience and usually decided by existing authentication mechanisms already existing in your organization. Keep in mind that if you change your mind later on, you will have to updated permissions to resources. We are happy to assist you as necessary.

### Local & Social Accounts

Local account and social logins are two common login options for online services and applications. A local account login requires users to create a username and password. Immersive Fusion offers this functionality free of charge for customers. This type of login provides a high level of security and control for users but they are responsible for managing their own login credentials. However, it can also be inconvenient for users, as they need to remember multiple usernames and passwords for different services.

A social login allows users to access a service or application using their social media credentials, such as their GitHub account. This type of login can provide a more convenient and streamlined experience for users, as they do not need to create a new account or remember a new set of login credentials. However, it can also raise security and privacy concerns, as users may be sharing personal information with the service or application.
