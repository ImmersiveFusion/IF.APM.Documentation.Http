# Custom Application

A custom software application is a bespoke solution designed to meet the unique needs and requirements of a specific business or organization. Unlike off-the-shelf software applications, custom software is built from scratch and tailored to the specific needs of the client. Here are some key aspects of a custom software application:
1. Tailored to specific needs: Custom software applications are designed to meet the specific needs and requirements of a business or organization. This means that the application is built from the ground up to address the specific pain points and challenges faced by the client, rather than providing a one-size-fits-all solution.
1. Scalability: Custom software applications can be designed to be scalable, meaning that they can grow and adapt as the needs of the business change over time. This can be especially important for businesses that are experiencing rapid growth or change.
1. Integration: Custom software applications can be designed to integrate with other applications or systems that the business already uses. This can help to streamline workflows and reduce the time and effort required for manual data entry and processing.
1. Security: Custom software applications can be designed with security in mind, using best practices and the latest technologies to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.
1. Maintenance and support: Custom software applications require ongoing maintenance and support to ensure that they continue to meet the needs of the business over time. This can include bug fixes, updates, and enhancements to the application.

## Standard compliant applications

Even if the application you are trying to analyze and visualize is not custom written by you and your organization, it is still a good candidate if it is compliant with OpenTelemetry standards and can be configured for OpenTelemetry.
