Once you have at least one grid created, click on the instrumentation button :gear:

![Grids](../img/grids.png)

Follow the wizard to create your application grid API key, instrument your application and test the instrumentation setup. If you application is already instrumented, you just need to take the API key. 

!!! info "API keys are per Grid"
    Every application grid should have its own unique API key. Otherwise, trace/log data from two or more applications will be mixed together.
