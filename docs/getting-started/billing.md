# Billing

## Metererd Billing 

Metered billing is a pricing model where customers are charged based on their actual usage of a product or service. This differs from other pricing models, such as flat-rate or tiered pricing, where customers are charged a fixed fee regardless of their usage. There are several benefits of metered billing, both for businesses and customers.

* Fairness and transparency: Metered billing provides a fair and transparent way to charge customers based on their actual usage of a product or service. This means that customers only pay for what they use, which can increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.
* Cost savings: Metered billing can help customers save money by allowing them to pay only for what they need. This is especially beneficial for customers who have variable usage patterns, as they can avoid overpaying for unused resources.
* Predictable costs: While metered billing is based on usage, it can still provide customers with predictable costs. This is because businesses can provide customers with tools and resources to monitor their usage and predict their costs. This can help customers budget and plan for their expenses.
* Scalability: Metered billing can help businesses scale their services more efficiently. By charging customers based on their usage, businesses can better manage their resources and capacity, which can help them grow without incurring unnecessary costs.
* Flexibility: Metered billing can be more flexible than other pricing models, as businesses can adjust their rates based on market demand or changes in resource costs. This can help businesses remain competitive and attract customers who are looking for more flexible pricing options.
