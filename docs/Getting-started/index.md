Our solutions leverage immersion and ambient information and emphasize simplicity through ([Immersive APM](../Getting-started/Terms-and-Concepts/IAPM/index.md)). The solution enables software and operations engineers with the ability to view their entire application all at once in order to perform quick and effective root-cause analysis, decrease downtime, and have higher productivity. With Immersive APM, software and operations engineers can start answering questions such as how their application is performing at any given moment, which part of their system is having issues, and what they can expect to happen given the current load.
