## Start sending trace information

Level of effort: `medium`

Time required: `15+ minutes`

The next step is to enable your application to start recording trace data. Trace data are detailed metrics about what an application is doing, how well, and how quickly it's doing the work. Once the data is collected, it is sent to a Fusion Hub for storage or to be visible in real-time in the Immersive APM client applications.

Instrumentation varies in complexity. Some of the available methods provide richer trace data than others, or they provide more performant collection for high-throughput environments at the expense of richness of the data.

!!! note ""
    Please note that we are constantly adding new integrations and instrumentation methods to help our customers get started quicker.

!!! note ""
    If the optimal method to collect trace data from your application is not yet available, we also have fall-back options based on ubiquitous technologies such as REST web services.

## Visualize in 3D/VR/Web

Level of effort: `low`

Time required: `10+ minutes`

### 3D/VR Client

Install the latest stable Immersive APM 3D client. The client displays real-time data coming from your application. If your license includes a Nexus instance or more, you will be able to see the information coming from the Nexus in the client as well.
