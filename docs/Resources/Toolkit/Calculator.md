!!! info "Usage Weight"
    Usage weight is a simple way to break down your scenarios. For example, using only the Visualize plan would have a usage weight of 100%. A mix of Visualize and Analyze packages can be accomplished by splitting the percentage. For example, %50 in Visualize and %50 in Analyze.
