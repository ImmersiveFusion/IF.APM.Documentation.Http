# APM Basics

Application Performance Management (APM) is the process of monitoring and managing the performance and availability of software applications. APM tools typically leverage a [observability framework](../Observability/index.md) to monitor and analyze application performance metrics, such as response time, resource usage, and error rates, in order to identify issues and help ensure that applications perform optimally.

APM solutions can be used to monitor a wide variety of applications, including web and mobile applications, databases, and cloud-based services. They can also be used to monitor the performance of entire IT infrastructures, including servers, networks, and storage systems.

APM solutions typically use a combination of monitoring agents, data collectors, and analytics tools to collect and analyze performance data. This data is then used to provide insights into application performance, identify potential issues, and enable proactive monitoring and management.

APM is an important aspect of modern software development and operations, as it helps organizations ensure that their applications are performing optimally and meeting the needs of their users. It can also help organizations identify and resolve issues quickly, before they impact users or cause downtime.
