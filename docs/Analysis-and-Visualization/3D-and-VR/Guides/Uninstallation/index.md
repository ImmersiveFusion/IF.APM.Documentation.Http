# Uninstallation

Immersive APM is a software application built on top of the Unity 3D engine and is a standalone software program that runs on a user's computer. The application needs to be installed in order to access the necessary files and resources required to run.

Uninstalling a program means removing the program from your computer's hard drive. This process removes all files, folders, and registry entries associated with the program from your system, effectively reversing the installation process. When a program is installed, it creates various files and settings on your computer to enable it to function correctly. When you uninstall a program, those files and settings are removed, and the program is no longer accessible or available on your computer. This frees up space on your hard drive and ensures that the program is not taking up unnecessary resources on your system.

When the application is uninstalled, all necessary files and resources, such as textures, sounds, and scripts, needed to run the application are removed from the computer. Uninstalling the application ensures that it is properly registered with the user's operating system, which can help prevent conflicts and issues with other software programs installed on the computer. By properly installing an application, you can ensure that it runs smoothly and without any issues, and provides the best possible experience for the user. 

You can always reinstall Immersive APM at a later point.
