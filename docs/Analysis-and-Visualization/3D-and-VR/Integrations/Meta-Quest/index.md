# Meta Quest

Immersive APM for 3D & VR will automatically detect when you have a supported headset and controllers attached.

If you have a Quest 2 or 3 device, follow the [Set up Meta Quest Link](https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-link/set-up-link/) available from Meta.

You will see Immersive APM as an option once you complete your Quest Link setup and Launch into the device.
