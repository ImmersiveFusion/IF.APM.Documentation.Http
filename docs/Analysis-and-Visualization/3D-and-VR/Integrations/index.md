# Integrations

Immersive APM for 3D and VR is built on top of Unity, which is a popular game engine that is used to develop games and other interactive applications. One of the great benefits of Unity is its ability to integrate with a wide range of hardware devices, such as headsets and controllers. This allows users to experience the application in a more immersive and engaging way.

    We are continuously working on new integrations and will release more information as it becomes available.

Headsets are a popular hardware device that can be used to enhance the user's experience with Unity applications. Headsets such as Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and Samsung Gear VR can provide a fully immersive experience, allowing the user to feel like they are inside the game or application. This can be particularly useful for games that involve exploring virtual worlds, or for applications that require the user to move around in a virtual space.

Controllers are another popular hardware device that can be integrated with Unity applications. Controllers such as the Xbox controller or the PlayStation controller can provide a more tactile and responsive experience, allowing the user to interact with the application in a more natural and intuitive way. This can be particularly useful for games that require precise control, such as first-person shooters or racing games.

The benefits of integrating headsets and controllers with Unity applications are numerous. For one, it can make the application more engaging and immersive, providing a more memorable experience for the user. Additionally, it can make the application more accessible, allowing users to interact with it in a way that feels more natural and intuitive. Finally, it can make the application more fun and entertaining, providing a more enjoyable experience overall.
