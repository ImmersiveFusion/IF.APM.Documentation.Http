# Instrumentation Standards

{!template/coming-soon.mdp!}

Trace data can be structured in many ways or not at all. Immersive APM organizes trace data automatically in the background. We also offer compliance with published and common standards in order to facilitate more intuitive experience for our users who may have used a standard before.

## OpenTelemetry

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/){target=ot} provides a single set of APIs, libraries, agents, and collector services to capture distributed traces and metrics from your application.

Immersive APM supports OpenTelemetry and conforms to the published APIs. When instrumenting with the Immersive APM OpenTelemetry packages, the host application leverages OpenTelemetry API patterns and enables Immersive APM exporters. Any customer already using OpenTelemetry APIs can quickly enable Immersive APM inside the application.
