# Manual Instrumentation

{!template/coming-soon.mdp!}

Low-level instrumentation packages enable detailed application tracing but require more effort. 
Low level hooks and tracing is typically used for high-throughput applications where only a subset of trace data is needed.  
Detailed tracing may also be used to trace critical application process flows.
